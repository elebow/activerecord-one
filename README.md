# activerecord-one

Provides `ActiveRecord::Relation#one!`, a convenience method that asserts a relation contains exactly one record and returns it. If there are no records or more than one, an `ActiveRecord::NoRecordFound` or `ActiveRecord::MultipleRecordsFound` exception is raised, respectively.

`#one!` reads as follows:

```ruby
def one!
  case size
  when 0
    raise ActiveRecord::NoRecordFound
  when 1
    first
  else
    raise ActiveRecord::MultipleRecordsFound
  end
end
```

## Why not use `find_by`?
`find_by` doesn't verify uniqueness. The Rails documentation for the method says:
>Finds the first record matching the specified conditions. There is no implied ordering so if order matters, you should specify it yourself.

Therefore, given the following records:

```
#<Record id: 1, name: "Alice", color: "red">,
#<Record id: 2, name: "Bob", color: "blue">,
#<Record id: 3, name: "Bob", color: "green">
```

The following expression has **undefined behavior**:

```ruby
Record.find_by(name: "Bob")    # could return record 2 or record 3!
```
The record returned is whatever the database decides is first. There's no way to tell from the code alone which it will be, or that such a thing has even happened. In other words, `find_by` is only safe when you specify the order of rows, or have confidence that no more than one row will matchâ€”usually thanks to a uniqueness constraint in the database.

If you expect only one row to match but don't have a database uniqueness constraint (perhaps due to non-unique legacy data, for example), you would need to do something like:
```ruby
raise unless Record.where(name: "Bob").count == 1
Record.find_by(name: "Bob")
```
Or, with this gem:
```ruby
Record.where(name: "Bob").one!
```

## Shouldn't this be provided by Rails?
Probably. See https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/26206.
